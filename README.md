Descripion of the UI Design
This React component represents a service management system, allowing users to create, edit, and manage services by defining multiple steps for each service. Users can dynamically add, update, or remove steps, with each step representing a key phase in a service workflow (e.g., "Discovery Call," "Invoice").

The UI leverages Material UI (MUI) for design and includes a Stepper component to display the service process. While API calls are currently commented out, the system was likely intended to fetch categories and subcategories from a backend. This component is useful in project management, service onboarding, or workflow automation platforms where structured processes need to be followed.
